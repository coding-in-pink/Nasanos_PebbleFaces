## What It Is
While Pebble was still around and its community still buzzing with activity around the Pebble Time and Pebble Time Round watches, I took some time to develop some watch faces. The goal I had was to make one or more watch faces specifically designed around a round screen -- faces that adhered to and capitalized on being displayed on a circular screen.

The result was a series of watch faces experimenting with both concentric shape and texture. Of those, the three given here -- Orbitus, Concentrate, and Sunalsorises -- stood out as best representing those efforts.

## Features
* Circular designs and textures using trigonomic functions
* Integrated watch's health-tracking capabilities
* Implemented in C
